## **Unit 2 â€“ Control Structures & Loops**  

### ðŸ“Œ **Description of the Unit:**  
In this unit, we focused on developing algorithms using PSeInt, emphasizing control structures such as `if`, `if-else`, and loops. We explored different types of loops, including `while` and `for`, understanding their applications and efficiency in iterative processes. By implementing loops, we learned how to automate repetitive tasks, optimize algorithm performance, and enhance problem-solving strategies.

## **Unit 3 â€“ GITHUB**  

### ðŸ“Œ **Description of the Unit:**  
In this unit, we learned how to use GitHub for version control and collaboration. We explored key concepts such as repositories, commits, branches, forks, merges, and pull requests, gaining an understanding of how multiple developers can work on a project simultaneously.

We practiced creating and managing branches to develop features separately without affecting the main code. We also learned how to use forks to contribute to projects outside our own repositories. Additionally, we worked with merging and resolving conflicts, ensuring smooth integration of changes.
